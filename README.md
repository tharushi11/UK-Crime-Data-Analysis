# UK Crime Data Analysis (2014-2016)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the analysis and visualization of crime data from the United Kingdom, covering the years 2014 to 2016. The analysis explores patterns, trends, and factors influencing crime outcomes across various regions and crime categories, using both descriptive and predictive analytical methods.

## Contents

### 1. R Scripts

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Scripts for integrating, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis.
Descriptive Analysis: Scripts for exploring crime patterns and trends across time and regions.
Hypothesis Testing: Linear regression and ANOVA tests to analyze relationships between time, crime types, and regions.
Predictive Modeling: Includes:
Linear Regression
Clustering
Random Forest Classification


### 2. Report

A detailed report summarizing the methodology, findings, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.



## Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates the following skills:

#### Data Wrangling:
Cleaning and preprocessing raw datasets for analysis.
Handling missing data and transforming variables.

#### Statistical Analysis:
Linear regression and ANOVA testing for hypothesis validation.
Correlation analysis with multiple comparisons adjustment.

#### Visualization:
Creating informative visualizations using ggplot2 and Plotly.
Using clustering visualizations to interpret groupings.

#### Predictive Modeling:
Building and interpreting linear regression models.
Implementing Random Forest classification models for predictions.
Clustering:
Using the Elbow Method to identify optimal clusters.
Performing K-Means clustering on crime data.
Programming in R:

Writing efficient R scripts for analytical workflows.
Leveraging libraries such as dplyr, ggplot2, caret, and factoextra.

#### Results
Key Findings
Trends: Significant changes in crime types over time and across regions.
Correlations: Strong relationships between specific crime categories and time.
Clustering: Identified meaningful groupings of regions based on crime patterns.
Classification: Successfully trained a Random Forest model to predict regions based on crime types 

## About This Project
This project represents my first attempt at using R for data analysis and visualization. It has been an exciting learning experience, helping me explore the capabilities of R for:

Cleaning and preprocessing complex datasets.
Conducting statistical tests like regression and ANOVA.
Building predictive models and creating meaningful visualizations.
