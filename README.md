# UK-Crime-Data-Analysis
Introduction
This repository contains the analysis and visualization of crime data from the United Kingdom, covering the years 2014 to 2016. The analysis explores patterns, trends, and factors influencing crime outcomes across various regions and crime categories, using both descriptive and predictive analytical methods.

Contents
1. R Scripts
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Scripts for integrating, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis.
Descriptive Analysis: Scripts for exploring crime patterns and trends across time and regions.
Hypothesis Testing: Linear regression and ANOVA tests to analyze the relationship between time, crime types, and regions.
Predictive Modeling: Includes:
Linear Regression
Clustering
Random Forest Classification
Visualization: ggplot2 and Plotly-based visualizations for insights into the data.
2. Report
A detailed report summarizing the methodology, findings, and conclusions drawn from the analysis. This includes:
Data preprocessing techniques
Insights from descriptive and predictive modeling
Critical reviews of tools and techniques used
